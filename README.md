# Singular_Assessment
Assessment done for Singular Solutions.
This is to showcase what I am currently working on at PBTit and what I can do.
I'll be sending my free time on this to do any improvements I can as this was hastily thrown together over a weekend.

TODO list:
I am going to refactor the ddal.cs page to a more dynamic nature where the db will get the parameters of the proc that will be called along with their data type. Then work in a solution that will manage multiple requests by placing them on different threads that can be interupted if the same request is received with different parameters, or carry on with the original request if the parameters match up.

I'll be adding css to pretty up the UI. At the moment the css is just to place the dom elements on the page.

I'll be adding quite a lot of JavaScript functions to handle formatting, data validations, and any other functions that I will require.
